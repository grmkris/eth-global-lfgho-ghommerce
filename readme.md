## Problem

The e-commerce sector is struggling with several significant issues. High transaction fees, lengthy settlement times, and cross-border payment issues drastically burden both merchants and customers.  

Furthermore, the practical integration of cryptocurrencies with e-commerce platforms often remains a complex task. This complexity necessitates a steep learning curve from customers and deep technical proficiency from merchants, acting as a firm barrier against widespread crypto adoption.  

Numerous businesses are forced to compromise their preferred operational models due to the lack of versatile invoicing systems and customized payment solutions. Similarly, consumers find their ability to leverage digital assets within an e-commerce context considerably limited, restricting their financial flexibility.  

Lastly, the prevalent norm of e-commerce platforms acting as custodial entities raises critical trust issues. The inherent lack of financial autonomy negates the core advantage of decentralization, emphasizing the urgent need for a genuinely decentralized, blockchain-centric solution effective enough to create a seamless web3 e-commerce environment.
