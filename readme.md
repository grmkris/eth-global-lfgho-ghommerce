## Summary
Meet Ghommerce: A seamless e-commerce platform revolutionizing merchant transactions. Simplify payments with modular invoicing, versatile integrations, and our SDK. Empower customers to leverage crypto for credit, while merchants can invest earnings


## Problem

The classical e-commerce sector is struggling with several significant issues. 
 - high transaction fees, 
 - lengthy settlement times,
 - currency conversion

**These issues drastically burden both merchants and customers.** 

Furthermore, the practical integration of cryptocurrencies with e-commerce platforms often remains a complex task.
Merchants are faced with a variety of challenges, including:
  - complex integrations, requiring deep technical knowledge 
  - lack of customized payment options

Consumers, on the other hand:
  - are often limited to a single payment option, restricting their financial flexibility. 
  - find their ability to leverage digital assets within an e-commerce context considerably limited, restricting their financial flexibility.  

Lastly, the prevalent norm of e-commerce platforms acting as custodial entities raises critical trust issues.  
**The inherent lack of financial autonomy negates the core advantage of decentralization, emphasizing the urgent need for a genuinely distributed, blockchain-centric solution effective enough to create a seamless web3 e-commerce environment.**
